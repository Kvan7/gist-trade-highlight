## Styles

### Raw Tag Based

[Install](https://github.com/Kvan7/gist-trade-highlight/raw/refs/heads/main/tagOnly.user.css)

Very rudimentary, just strictly takes the tags on the mods and adds different colors to different tags. The only changes
to strictly the in game tags are adding different colors to str, dex, and int, not showing bleeding as physical, and making
+levels without the "gem" tag display as +levels with the "gem" tag.

### Raw Tag Based, compact only

[Install](https://github.com/Kvan7/gist-trade-highlight/raw/refs/heads/main/tagOnlyCompact.user.css)

Same as above, but doesn't change the "default" view, only the compact one(which had a small amount of highlighting before)
