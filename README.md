# User style for trade 2

If you don't know what a userstyle is, probably don't install, i'm not going to provide base troubleshooting instructions

## Install

Given you have stylus or some other userstyle manager (or if you do it manually),

1. Find which style you want to install
2. Click "Raw" on the gist
  - This should open in with your userstyle manager, just hit save there
